# Financial Model Enumerator

Financial-Model-Enumerator is a utility designed to systematically read, analyze, and update financial models in Excel spreadsheets. This tool is especially useful for automating repetitive tasks, such as updating financial forecasts, analyzing model structures, and ensuring that formulas and data are consistent across different models.

## Key Features and Functions

### Enumerate All Cells
- **Purpose**: Identify and list all relevant cells in a financial model, including those containing data, formulas, and labels.
- **Implementation**: Use `pandas` or `openpyxl` to traverse the entire spreadsheet, capturing metadata like cell coordinates, content type (data/formula), and dependencies.

### Identify Key Metrics
- **Purpose**: Automatically identify and tag key financial metrics (e.g., Revenue, Expenses, Net Income) based on common labels or positions within the spreadsheet.
- **Implementation**: Use keyword matching or predefined templates to find and mark these cells for easy reference.

### Track Formula Dependencies
- **Purpose**: Understand how different cells are linked, especially those involved in key financial calculations.
- **Implementation**: Parse formulas using `openpyxl` to map out dependencies, which can be visualized as a graph.

### Update Values
- **Purpose**: Automatically update specific cells, either based on new input data or calculated adjustments, while ensuring that dependent formulas update accordingly.
- **Implementation**: Define update rules (e.g., replace all instances of a certain metric) and apply them across the model.

### Audit Consistency
- **Purpose**: Verify that formulas and values are consistent across different parts of the model or across multiple models.
- **Implementation**: Compare cells across sheets or workbooks, checking for formula consistency, and flagging discrepancies.

### Generate Reports
- **Purpose**: Summarize the structure and key findings from the financial model, such as a list of key metrics, their locations, and any updates made.
- **Implementation**: Output reports as new Excel sheets, PDFs, or text files.

### Integration with External Data
- **Purpose**: Integrate real-time financial data (e.g., from Yahoo Finance) to automatically update the model.
- **Implementation**: Use APIs or web scraping to pull data and populate the model.

## How This Can Be Extended

- **Enhanced Enumeration**: Track more complex structures, like multi-sheet references or conditional formatting.
- **Advanced Dependency Tracking**: Build a graph of cell dependencies, useful for understanding the ripple effect of changes.
- **GUI or Web Interface**: Build a user interface to interact with models visually, making it easier to manage and update large financial models.
- **Automation**: Integrate with job scheduling tools to regularly update models with fresh data (e.g., nightly updates with the latest stock prices).

## Conclusion

Financial-Model-Enumerator can be a powerful tool for finance professionals who need to manage and update complex financial models efficiently.
